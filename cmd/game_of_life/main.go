	// Function to calculate next board state from current board state
	// Game loop to calculate next game state, display the board

	// That's the basics out of the way. Other thoughts:

	// Unit test the calculation of next game state if we haven't already
	// Use Ebiten to draw the game board
	// Add play/pause toggle
	// Add clear/reset toggle
	// Add a speed slider
	// Toggle cells with mouse click
	// Implement some additional seeds, have a picker to load the chosen seed
	// Add a way to save a seed from the current game state
	// Deploy game to a website using WASM
